Hello Atin,

I have added code for calculating happiness score
I have added code for svm classifier which needs train and test csv files as input and prints prediction file as output in same repository


Tasks that you have to do:
1. write a code to get the sentiment score of text using nltk
2. write a code to get the positive and negative word count as told by adarsh
3. merge nltk code, positive and negative word count code and happines score and 
  print the output of each document into csv file.(same format as train.csv file)
  
  so after this we can use this file as train and test files for classifer
